# the-point-of-growth 🚀

the-point-of-growth is a modern React application built with TypeScript and Vite, designed to provide a dynamic and engaging user experience. It leverages the power of React Query for efficient data fetching and management, MobX for state management, and Emotion for styled components, offering a robust foundation for building complex UIs.

## ✨ Features

*   **Dynamic Event Management**: Browse, view, and interact with various events.
*   **User Accounts**: Manage user profiles and related information.
*   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a seamless experience across different devices.
*   **Efficient Data Fetching**: Utilizes React Query for robust caching and background updates.
*   **State Management**: Employs MobX for predictable and observable state management.
*   **Styling**: Leverages Emotion for powerful CSS-in-JS styling capabilities.
*   **Routing**: Implements client-side routing for smooth navigation with `react-router-dom`.
*   **Code Quality**: Enforces code consistency with ESLint and TypeScript.

## 🚀 Installation

To get started with the-point-of-growth, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-point-of-growth.git
    cd the-point-of-growth
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    This project uses both `npm` and `pnpm`. It's recommended to use `pnpm` for faster and more efficient dependency management.

    **Using pnpm (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    **Using npm**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *Note: If `pnpm` is not installed, you can install it globally via `npm install -g pnpm`.*

## 💡 Usage

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

1.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    # or
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite) with hot module replacement enabled.

    The `vite.config.ts` file includes a proxy configuration for development:
    ```javascript
    server: {
      proxy: {
        "/api": {
          target: "http://62c8d468f852.vps.myjino.ru:49196",
          changeOrigin: true,
          secure: false,
        },
      },
    },
    ```
    This means requests starting with `/api` will be proxied to the specified backend server during development.

2.  **Build for production**:
    To create an optimized build of the application for deployment:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    # or
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will generate the static assets in the `dist` directory.

3.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
    The project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages`.
    ```bash
    pnpm deploy
    # or
    npm run deploy
    ```
